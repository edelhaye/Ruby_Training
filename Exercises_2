# Exercise 5: Define a class animal. Add methods.
class Animal

  def initialize
    puts "Creating a new animal"
  end
  
  def set_name(new_name)
    @name = new_name
  end
  
  def name
    @name
  end
  
  def sound
    return generic_sound
  end
end


# Exercise 6: Create a new animal, a cat. Set his name to Peekaboo.
cat = Animal.new
cat.set_name("Peekaboo")
puts cat.name


# Exercise 7: Make Cats inherit from Animal
# Add a function to the class animals that represent the sound it makes
# Define the sound of your cat to “Miaw”

# Exercise 1 :Define a string variable with your name and print out the variable.
my_name = "Emilie"
print "Emilie"


# Exercise 2: Define two integer variables: first_number and second_number. Assign a value to each variable. 
# Use the five arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, /, %) to perform operations on the two integers.
# Print the results of your arithmetic operations 

first_number = 50
second_number = 10

puts first_number + second_number
puts first_number - second_number
puts first_number * second_number
puts first_number / second_number
puts first_number % second_number


# Exercise 3: Now we want the user to define the value of our variables.

print "Enter a first number: "
first_number = gets.to_i
print "Enter a second number: "
second_number = gets.to_i

puts first_number + second_number
puts first_number - second_number
puts first_number * second_number
puts first_number / second_number
puts first_number % second_number


# Exercise 4: The user needs to define his name and age. The code needs to print out the following complete sentence:
# "Hello, your name is Sam and you are 20 years old."

name = "Emilie"
age = 25
puts  "Hello, your name is #{name} and you are #{age} years old. "

# Exercise 5: Conditionals

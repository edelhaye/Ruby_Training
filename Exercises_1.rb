# Exercise 1 :Define a string variable with your name and print out the variable.
my_name = "Emilie"
print my_name


# Exercise 2: Define two integer variables: first_number and second_number. Assign a value to each variable. 
# Use the five arithmetic operators ( +, -, *, /, %) to perform operations on the two integers.
# Print the results of your arithmetic operations 

first_number = 50
second_number = 10

puts first_number + second_number
puts first_number - second_number
puts first_number * second_number
puts first_number / second_number
puts first_number % second_number


# Exercise 3: Now we want the user to define the value of our variables.

print "Enter a first number: "
first_number = gets.to_i
print "Enter a second number: "
second_number = gets.to_i

puts first_number + second_number
puts first_number - second_number
puts first_number * second_number
puts first_number / second_number
puts first_number % second_number


# Exercise 4: The user needs to define his name and age. The code needs to print out the following complete sentence:
# "Hello, your name is Sam and you are 20 years old."

name = "Emilie"
age = 25
puts  "Hello, your name is #{name} and you are #{age} years old. "


# Exercise 5: show in editor

a = 9
b = 3
c = 7

a / b <= b
100 % b != c % b
a % b == c / b || a / b – 1 == c / b


# Conditionals: Control flow in Ruby
if 1 < 2
  print "I'm getting printed because one is less than two!"
end
 
if 10 < 2
  print "I'm getting printed because one is less than two!"
else 
  print "Dummie, ten is not less than two!"
end


# Challenge Exercise 6

print "Enter a length variable: "
length = gets.to_i
print "Enter a width variable: "
width = gets.to_i
print "Enter a height variable: "
height = gets.to_i


if length >=0 && width >=0 && height >=0
  volume= length*width*height
  print volume
else puts 'Can not calculate volume'
end


# Challenge Exercise 7

print "Enter your grade: "
grade = gets.chomp

case grade
when "A"
  puts 'Well done!'
when "B"
  puts 'Try harder!'
when "C"
  puts 'You need help!!!'
